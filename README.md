# Far-Field-Diffraction-Simulator
In this project, we used Matlab to simulate the diffraction patterns of various apertures in the form of far-field diffractions. In order to get any sort of  diffraction patterns, we had to first construct aperture simulators. In real life, light is sent through the apertures’ slits and then interferes with itself as it passes through the slits as in this situation, light acts as a wave, so much like how water waves interfere with themselves through channels or canals, light can behave in a similar manner. These interference patterns are useful for determining a wave’s wavelength, but sometimes one does not always have access to interferometers or other equipment necessary to observe this optical phenomenon, so constructing a virtual diffraction grating can be used to obtain similar results, but without possible sources of error due to equipment malfunction or environmental contamination (such as bumping into the surface the gratings are resting on or only being as precise as the least precise measuring tool on your person). One may also use the generated diffractions patterns to measure against real-life diffraction patterns and vice versa to find other possible errors in said diffraction patterns.
